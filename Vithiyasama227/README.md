# About the Framework – ASP.NET MVC Web

The ASP.NET MVC framework is a template provided by Microsoft, which implements the model–view–controller (MVC) pattern.

## About the App

  The "ToDo" Web app is created using ASP.NET MVC framework in order to showcase a App that will do CRUD operations using a database and to demonstrate other Web app functionalities. 

## Prerequisites
  - Visual Studio
  - Microsoft Azure SDK 
  - Azure subscription
  
## Folder Structure
  - DataAccessLayer
  	- Contract
  	- Models
  	- Repository
  - Domain
  	- Models
  - BusinessLogic
  	- Service Location
  - App
  	- Controllers
  	- Models
  	- Scripts
  	- Views
		
### Data Access Layer 

This is data access layer, which will interact with the database. Connection Strings should be configured in Web.Config. Database context will be created using this connection strings and database call will be invoked.

### Domain layer

This layer contains the domain model which is used in the application. In this we have used DataAnnotations for validing user input.

### Business Logic Layer

This layer is responsible for implementing business logic and conversion to / from DAL and Domain models. In this we have used auto mapper to do mapping between Domain and DAL models.

### App Layer

This is a Web application using MVC 5 architecture.

Below are the features implemented in the application. 

#### Logging

For this there is an adapter called Logger which is inside Util folder in the application. 
To enable logging in Azure, login to https://portal.azure.com and navigate to your web app. Then click on “All Settings” -> then click on “Diagnostics logs” inside Features. Then based on your requirement you can either choose Filesystem or Blob. You can also select the level of logging you want. After configuring the logging click “Save” on top of the panel. 

#### Validation

##### Client side validation

For client side validation you just need to put the below script in the view, it will automatically validate the form based on the model DataAnnotations 
```sh
@Scripts.Render("~/bundles/jqueryval")
```

##### Server side validation

For server side validation you need to use the below, this will return a bool based on model passed :-
```sh
if (ModelState.IsValid){}
```

#### Exception handling

If an exception is thrown in the application, user will be taken to an error page after logging the error. All the unhandled exceptions would be caught in the controller.

#### Dependency injection 

This is to inject the dependency. For this there is an adapter name "UnityConfig" in App_Start folder. You need to register your type inside RegisterTypes function.
```sh
 container.RegisterType<IProductRepository, ProductRepository>();
```

## Unit test case execution:

 The test cases for the operations are present in the <ApplicationProjectName>tests Project. These test cases are executed using Visual Studio.
 To run the test cases goto "Test" menu and select "Run" sub-menu then select the options like All Tests/Passed Tests/Failed Tests/Not Run Tests
 
## Code coverage:

We can check the code coverage for each of the file using Visual studio. To check the code coverage goto "Test" menu and select "Analyze Code Coverage" then select the options like Selected Tests/All Tests
 
## Code analysis:

- Code Analysis is important to deliver perfect product
- Code Analysis can be setting can be done by following below steps
- "Right Click" on Solution Explorer --> Properties --> Common Properties --> Code Analysis Settings --> 
 	"Select Each Project" --> "Microsoft Managed Recommended Rules"
  
## How to run the application in your local machine:

- Add/Update connection details of the database in Web.Config.
- Build and Run the solution

## Deploying to Azure

- Select the WebApp which needs to be Hosted in Server
- Right Click on the Project and choose "Publish"
- Choose/Create new Deployment profile
- Update Connetion/Settings if any
- Verify the package which is being deployed using Preview
- Click "Publish"
# About Azure DocumentDB

Azure DocumentDB is a fully managed NoSQL database service built for fast and predictable performance, high availability, automatic scaling, and ease of development. Its flexible data model, consistent low latencies, and rich query capabilities make it a great fit for web, mobile, gaming, and IoT, and many other applications that need seamless scale.

## To Run the application in Local machine

- Update the Server Key values in Web.Config AppSettings section

>     <add key="endpoint" value="<<EndPoint_Name>>"/>
>     <add key="authKey" value="<<Aunthentication_Key>>/>
>     <add key="database" value="<<DB_Name>>"/>
>     <add key="collection" value="<<Collection_Name>>"/>

## How DocumentDB is used in this ToDo App?

In this ToDo app, the functionalities are seperated by layers. And DAL is responsible for making the communication with DocumentDB. 

- DAL
  	- Contract
		IRepository - Generic functionalities of DocumentDB method declarations
		Repository  - Implementations of generic methods
   	
	- Models
		ToDoItem - Model object. (Note: Add model objects here to extend this application)

   	- Repository
		IToDoRepository - Functionalities specific to ToDoItem object are declared here. This interface should have to inherit IRepository
		ToDoRepository  - Method Implementations of ToDoItem is defined here. This class should implement IToDoRepository

## Steps to Extend the application functionalities

	- Create new model object under DAL - Models folder
	- Create new Object specific repository class and interfaces
	- Inherit the Object specific interface from IRepository interface
	- Override the functionalities in the new class and make a call to the methods of Repository class

## List of functionlaities implented for ToDoItem Object
	
	Connection should be established to make a communication between client and DocumentDB. The below code will establish the connection object.

			new DocumentClient(new Uri(<<Document DB EndPoint>>), <<Primary/Secondary Key of the DocumentDB>>);

	- Create
	- GetAll
	- GetByID
	- Update
	- Delete

### Create Method
	
	This method is responsible for creating/inserting a generic object/document into specified DocumentDB.

	client.CreateDocumentAsync(UriFactory.CreateDocumentCollectionUri(<<Your_DatabaseName>>, <<Your_CollectionName>>), <<Your Object>>)

	The above method returns a document which was inserted.

### GetAll Method
	
	This method is responsible for fetching the documents from the mentioned collection as a list.

	client.CreateDocumentQuery<TObject>(UriFactory.CreateDocumentCollectionUri(<<Your_DatabaseName>>, <<Your_CollectionName>>)).AsDocumentQuery();

### GetByID Method
	
	This method is responsible for fetching the documents based upon the search criteria.

	client.ReadDocumentAsync(UriFactory.CreateDocumentUri(<<Your_DatabaseName>>, <<Your_CollectionName>>, <<Search_ID>>));

### Update Method
	
	This method is responsible for updating the document.

	client.ReplaceDocumentAsync(UriFactory.CreateDocumentCollectionUri(<<Your_DatabaseName>>, <<Your_CollectionName>>), <<Object_To_Be_Replaced>>, null);

### Delete Method
	
	This method is responsible for deleting the document.

	client.DeleteDocumentAsync(UriFactory.CreateDocumentUri(<<Your_DatabaseName>>, <<Your_CollectionName>>, <<ID_To_Be_Deleted));
